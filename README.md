# Pharmakon

This is a prototype in the making for an app which is focused on a user's substance use. 

Functionality: 

- It will allow users to monitor their medication, receiveing reminders to take their medication at fixed times. 
- Users will be able to check if they can combine certain substances, for instance SSRIs with alcohol (which is a definite no). 
- Users will be able to ask for recommendations in regard to certain effects they would like to experience. For instance, if the user inputs "Better Sleep", they would be offered
a range of substances that would help them achieve the desired outcome (in this case, a strong candidate would be melatonin), informing them of the ideal dosage, best time to be
taken and the possible side effects, and withdrawal effects. 
- The drugs compatibility will be calculated based on the receptors they affect, their class, and the user's body type. 


The app will be made in collaboration with professionals in the fields of Pharmacology, Pharmacy and biology. 
Eventually, user's medics will be able to overview their activity, unless the user wants to set the monitoring to "private".
